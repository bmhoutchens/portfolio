          <p id = "backstory" class = "subTextFormat">
            My story begins in the south suburbs of Chicago, Illinois. In elementary school, I never 
            had any trouble in my classes, and was a top student. This, coupled with the fact that I was a severe 
            introvert at the time, made me a prime target for some of the other, not so nice students. Eventually 
            highschool came along and I was again, in the top of my class for the majority of my 
            career. During this time, I had my first introduction to programming. We had an elective called Computer 
            Science 101, and decided to join the class. In this class 
            we learned java, and I really enjoyed it. Over the next few years, I took a variety of different programming
            classes covering several different popular languages. These languages included 
            Python, Small Basic, and App Inventor(a program used to create apps for android devices). During this time 
            I held several jobs, starting with McDonalds at the age of 16. After that, I moved onto Subway, Oberweis, 
            and then The Home Depot, when I moved out to Indiana in the Spring of 
            2016. After about 2 years of working there, I moved to St. Vincent 86th for a few months as an Inventory Coordinator 
            before going to the Eleven Fifty programming bootcamp. There, I spent twelve weeks learning several new skills to add to my 
            repertoire including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Angular. We also practiced Agile, and partner coding.

            Over the years, many things have garnered my interest. Some of those I have kept until this day, 
            while others, I have let go. Following, are a few things that I still partake in today.
