            My story begins in Illinois, the south suburbs of Chicago to be exact. In elementary school, I never 
            had any trouble in my classes, and was a top student. This, coupled with the fact that I was a severe 
            introvert at the time, made me a prime target for some of the other, not so nice students. Eventually 
            time went on, and highschool came along. I was again, in the top of my class for the majority of my highschool 
            career. During this time, I had my first introduction to programming. We had an elective called Computer 
            Science 101, and I had always been interested in computers and decided to join the class. In this class 
            we learned java, and I really enjoyed it. Over the next few years, I took a variety of different programming
            classes in a variety of locations. These classes covered several different popular languages, including 
            Python, Small Basic, and App Inventor(a program used to create apps for android devices). During this time 
            I held several jobs, starting with McDonalds at the age of 16. After that, I moved onto Subway, where I 
            was the opening employee, Oberweis, and then The Home Depot, when I moved out to Indiana in the Spring of 
            2016. There, I held several positions, starting with part time cashier, and ending with being the sole 
            receiving associate. After that, I worked St. Vincent hospital for a few months as an Inventory Coordinator 
            before going to the Eleven Fifty programming bootcamp. There, I learned several new skills to add to my 
            repertoire including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
